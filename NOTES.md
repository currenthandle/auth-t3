## Oct 30 Recap

Great progress today!

1. We have end-to-end typesafe API routes with tRPC and Next.js. We also have a working example of a Next.js page using the API routes.
2. We are able to auth users from the db with the CredentialsProvider and we are getting a session / auth token. This is epic!!

## Oct 31 Looking Ahead

1. use bcrypt to hash passwords and compare passwords
2. Explore the useSession call and getStaticProps approach to make sure users are authed.
   2b. custom sign in page
3. Play around with permission gated rendering
4. Pick a simple app idea (shopping list, todo list, chat, calendar, places I've visted, vision board, habbit tracker, etc.)
5. Start building out application routes and UI from our app
