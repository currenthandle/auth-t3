## Oct 30 Recap

Great progress today!

1. We have end-to-end typesafe API routes with tRPC and Next.js. We also have a working example of a Next.js page using the API routes.
2. We are able to auth users from the db with the CredentialsProvider and we are getting a session / auth token. This is epic!!

## Oct 31 Looking Ahead

- <s>use bcrypt to hash passwords and compare passwords</s> DONE

- Explore the useSession call and getStaticProps approach to make sure users are authed.
- bcustom sign in page
- Play around with permission gated rendering
- Pick a simple app idea (shopping list, todo list, chat, calendar, places I've visted, vision board, habbit tracker, etc.)
- Start building out application routes and UI from our app
